Overview:

I have chosen to use SQL and R to analyze and visualize the available data concerning the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and Bank of Canada interest rates. I wanted to see how the decisions made by the Federal Government of Canada, and monetary policy set by the Bank of Canada have affected the cost of living in Canada. The majority of the data that I have sourced from Statistics Canada focuses mostly on conditions and changes to CPI and interest rates between September 2019 and August 2022. I have chosen this subject because it is one of the foremost of issues that Canadians from all walks of life are dealing with today. I believe that the COVID-19 pandemic had a direct impact on the sharp increase of the cost of living that we face today in Canda. However, I believe that looking over the pertinent data will tell a more detailed and convincing story.



What has happened during the pandemic as far as the cost of living in Canada is concerned:

Inflation is is the increase in the prices of goods and services. It is the decrease in the buying power of a unit of currency. The consumer price index (CPI) is used by governments and other institutions to measure changes in inflation. CPI is calculated by comparing the present cost of a basket of essential goods compared to the previous year. An increase in this number indicates that basic goods are getting more expensive.

The Bank of Canada also monitors inflation levels by keeping track of monthly changes in the cpi. The bank uses monetary policy to keep inflation levels under control. The Bank of Canada aims to keep these monthly changes at less than 3%. 

The COVID-19 lockdowns implemented by the Federal government of Canada, and the policies acted on by the Bank of Canada had a direct and immediate impact on the current level of price inflation. 

The effects of COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 had resulted in a significant decrease in the movement of people, and economic activity. Services that were deemed non essential were significantly limited or completely suspended. This also caused negative growth in the gross domestic product (GDP). Other industrialized economies around the world implemented similar policies having similar effects. This had an adverse effect on the supply chain, and contributed to both inflation and negative gdp growth. 

To counter-act any adverse economic effects of the lockdowns gdp growth, the BoC set interest rates to record lows of 0.25% for a period of twenty three months. This encouraged borrowing, spending, and economic activity during the pandemic. The BoC also indirectly lent the Canadian government $692 billion by purchasing government bonds in the bond market. The BoC also purchased bonds from provincial governments, and financial institutions to keep governments and markets functioning. These decisions were made to avoid an economic recession, and panic setting into the markets during the pandemic lockdowns.

The federal government has spent $576 B since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. Also putting this money in the hands of consumers, private businesses, and commercial banks. 
 
As of January of 2022, lockdowns were completely or nearly completely lifted. Participation in the labour place made a very quick recovery with rapidly improved employment numbers . Currently Canada is experiencing historically low levels of unemployment.

Non-mortgage and mortgage based Household debts also increased in Canada during the pandemic. There is more cash in the hands of Canadians today than there are goods and services available to meet demand. As a result, there has been an upward and steep trend in the consumer price index throughout 2022. This trend became more noticeable in the second quarter of 2022

The Bank of Canada has responded with record increases in interest rates, in an attempt to discourage spending and borrowing, to reign inflation in. Interest rates went from 0.25% to 2.50% in the span of 6 months. 

Inflation rates at 3% or lower help stimulate healthy economic growth. Lower than 2% indicates a possiblity of spiraling into deflation territory 0% or lower. A period of extended deflation can be the result of less consumer spending, a good indicator of an erosion in consumer confidence in the economy. Extended deflation or high inflation can result in panic, and a possible recession on the horizon. So a inflation rate target above 1% and below 3% is a comfortable position for the BoC.

The calculated monthly rate of inflation is well above this number as of August 2022, sitting at 7%. The BoC estimates that it takes 24 to 32 months to see it's policies take effect. This analysis stops at August 2022 before the inflation problem was resolved by the Bank of Canada, so further increases in price inflation rates are likely beyond 2022. 



What I have learned from the data:

It is abundantly evident that central bank monetary policy, and increased government and consumer spending have directly contributed to the inflationary rise in the prices of goods in Canada. This has also been further emphasized after observing the rate change over time in the CPI from 1960 to 2022.
